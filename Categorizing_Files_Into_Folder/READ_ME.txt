#Categorizing_Files_Into_Folder
Hey Buddy Welcome to my Repository, To Execute The Code "Categorization of Files" you must Follow following steps : 

Step-1: Firstly copy my "CategoryOfFiles.c" file or download and import it into Vs-Code.
Step-2: Save the file into some folder which you have imported into Vs-Code in your Computer, ex-"c projects directory".
Step-3: Create multiple files as you desire to categorize like-first.pdf,first.ppt in the directory where the c program stored.
Step-4: Execute "CategoryOfFiles.c" file into your PC and you will pleased to enter file name which will be categorized.
step-5: By Default it will create folder of individual files, like when you enter like - "first.pdf" it will create folder called pdf and move it into that pdf folder.

NOTE:- When you enter file name after execution, the file should be present in that corresponding directory where your program stored!
